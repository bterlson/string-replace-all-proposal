# String.prototype.replaceAll Proposal

## Status

Champion: Mathias Bynens (Google, @mathiasbynens).

This proposal is in stage 1 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/).


## Motivation

Currently there is no way to replace all instances of a substring in a string without use of a global regexp.
`String.prototype.replace` only affects the first occurrence when used with a string argument. There is a lot of evidence that developers are trying to do this in JS — see the [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144783/how-to-replace-all-occurrences-of-a-string-in-javascript) with thousands of votes.

Currently the most common way of achieving this is to use a global regexp.

```js
const queryString = 'q=query+string+parameters';
const withSpaces = queryString.replace(/\+/g, ' ');
```

## Proposed solution

We propose the addition of a new method to the String prototype - `replaceAll`. This would give developers a straight-forward way to accomplish this common, basic operation.

```js
const queryString = 'q=query+string+parameters';
const withSpaces = queryString.replaceAll('+', ' ');
```

It also removes the need to escape special regexp characters (note the unescaped `'+'`).

## High-level API

The proposed signature is the same as the existing `String.prototype.replace` method:

`String.prototype.replaceAll(searchValue, replaceValue)`

### `searchValue`

1. `searchValue` throws if it is a RegExp (there's no reason to use `replaceAll` with a RegExp `searchValue`). Otherwise, the remaining algorithm uses `ToString(searchValue)`. This option can be implemented very efficiently.

Alternative 1.1: Unconditionally use `ToString(searchValue)`, even if `searchValue` is a RegExp. Doesn't seem like a good option since this will break RegExp args in unexpected ways (e.e. `/./.toString()  // --> "/[.]/"`).

Alternative 1.2: If `searchValue` is a RegExp, create a clone including the 'g' flag and dispatch to `RegExp.prototype[@@replace]`. Otherwise, use `ToString(searchValue)`. There's precedent for this in `RegExp.prototype[@@split]`. This option seems consistent with user expectations; but we lose efficiency & simplicity on the implementation side, and we create an unexpected performance trap since cloning the regexp instance is slow.

### `replaceValue`

2. The algorithm uses `ToString(replaceValue)` and neither implements `GetSubstitution` semantics nor allows callable `replaceValue`. The `replace` function's interface is (perhaps unnecessarily) complex. We can take this opportunity to simplify, resulting in less cognitive load for users & simpler, more efficient implementations for VMs.

Alternative 2.1: As above, but implement `GetSubstitution` for more consistency with `replace`.

Alternative 2.2: As 2.1, but additionally allow callable `replaceValue` for more consistency with `replace`. Both 2.1 and 2.2 add complexity and overhead to the implementation.

Note that if alternative 1.2 is chosen above, then we need to support `GetSubstitution` semantics for `replaceValue` for consistency.

### `RegExp.prototype[@@replaceAll]`

3. There will be no new `RegExp.prototype[@@replaceAll]` function. Depending on the chosen solution for `searchValue`, RegExp arguments either throw or are forwarded to `@@replace`.

## Comparison to other languages

* Java has [replaceAll](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#replaceAll(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)), accepting a regexp (the actual param is a string, so simply putting your substring as the first param does the same thing we are proposing).
* Python [replace](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_replace.htm) replaces all occurrences, but accepts an optional param to limit the number of replacements.
* PHP has [str_replace](http://php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php) which has an optional limit parameter like python.
* Ruby has [gsub](https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-i-gsub), accepting a regexp or string, but also accepts a callback block and a hash of match -> replacement pairs.


## FAQ

Q: What are the main benefits? 

A: A simplified API for this common use-case that does not require RegExp knowledge. A way to global-replace strings without having to escape RegExp syntax characters. Possibly improved optimization potential on the VM side.

Q: What about adding a `limit` parameter to `replace` instead?

A: This is an awkward interface — because the default limit is 1, the user would have to know how many occurrences already exist, or use something like Infinity.
